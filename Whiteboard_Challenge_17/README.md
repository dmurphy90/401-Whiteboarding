# Problem Domain
Write a function that accepts a Tree and returns the total sum of all the elements in the tree. - You are to assume that each node will have a val property which has a numeric value. - Any other data points, aside from children are irrelevant.

## Solution and Tests
The function takes in a tree as the argument, and searches through the objects adding the value of each leaf to a counter and after it is done returning the combined values of all leaves.

The first test is checking that there was an argument provided in the first place. The second test is checking that input provided was a valid data type. The third test is checking to make sure that the function is outputting the correct results and the fourth test is just verifying that it is putting out the correct output by comparing it to the input.
