# Problem Domain

Write a function that accepts the root of a tree as it's argument, and returns an array of nodes, if any, which have no children.

## Solution and Tests
The function takes in a tree as the argument, and searches through the objects pushing those without children to an array and returning the final result of the array.

The first test is checking that there was an argument provided in the first place. The second test is checking that input provided was a valid data type. The third test is checking to make sure that the function is outputting the correct results and the fourth test is just verifying that it is putting out the correct output by comparing it to the input.
