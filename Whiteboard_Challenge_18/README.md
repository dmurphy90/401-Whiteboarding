# Problem Domain
Write a function which will return the max child count of a node within a k-ary tree

## Solution and Tests
The function takes in a k-ary tree as it's argument, and searches through the tree for the node with the most children by comparing the amount of children each node has and returning the Node with the most children.

The first test is checking that there was an argument provided in the first place. The second test is checking that input provided was a valid data type. The third test is checking to make sure that the function is outputting the correct results and the fourth test is just verifying that it is putting out the correct output by comparing it to the input.
