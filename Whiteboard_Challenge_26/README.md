# Whiteboard Challenge 26

## Problem Domain

Create a utils.js module which exports the following methods: map(), filter(), and reduce(). You will implement these methods from scratch, not utilizing the built-in array methods.

## Solution

Essentially all 3 functions are doing the same thing, they're iterating through the array and applying whatever callback function you apply to them and returning a new array whose values are based upon the callback you provided.
